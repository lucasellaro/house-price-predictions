Goal of the project:

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the prices of houses based on a range of features. The model will be trained on a dataset of historical housing prices and their associated attributes such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, and other factors. The ultimate objective of the project is to create a tool that can help potential home buyers, sellers, and real estate agents to estimate the fair market value of a property based on its features.

Contribution:

The contribution of this project lies in the development of a robust machine learning model that can predict the prices of houses with a high degree of accuracy. This will help home buyers and sellers to make more informed decisions when it comes to setting prices, negotiating offers, and making purchases. Real estate agents can also use this tool to better serve their clients and provide more accurate estimates of property values. Additionally, the project can contribute to the larger field of machine learning and data science by showcasing how these techniques can be applied to real-world problems such as housing price prediction.

Summary:

The project will involve collecting and cleaning a dataset of historical housing prices and their associated features. The data will then be used to train a machine learning model using techniques such as regression analysis, decision trees, and neural networks. The accuracy of the model will be evaluated using standard metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE). Once the model has been developed, it can be used to predict the prices of new properties based on their features. The final product will be a web-based tool that can be accessed by anyone looking to estimate the fair market value of a property.
